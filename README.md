# taxi-spark

Exploratory geospatial and temporal data analysis on NYC taxi trip data using Apache Spark inspired by [Advanced Analytics with Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do), by [Sandy Ryza](https://github.com/sryza), [Uri Laserson](https://github.com/laserson), [Sean Owen](https://github.com/srowen), and [Josh Wills](https://github.com/jwills). I'll add more description once I figure out what I want to do.
